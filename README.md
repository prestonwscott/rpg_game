## Similar to D&D, this RPG game has a lot of things to keep track of
Do not underestimate the power of stats:
- Armor class
- Dexterity
- Constitution
- Strength

Each of these play a vital role in your chances of victory during the battle sequence!
## Customize your character
Choose from a menu of randomly generated or manually specified stats that tailor your player towards survival. 
You can create endless amounts of players, but can only play n-1 map spaces of them if you wish to have any non-PVP gameplay!
## Play together
Invite your friends to sit and watch a dark terminal display and frantically wait for their turn. 
This exciting array of character sprites range from 48-122 on the ASCII table!
